  <h2>Book</h2>
  <p>A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images,
     typically composed of many pages (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper)
     bound together and protected by a cover. The technical term for this physical
     arrangement is codex (plural, codices). In the history of hand-held physical
     supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its predecessor, the scroll. A single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page.</p>
