  <h2>Piano</h2>
  <p>The piano is an acoustic, stringed musical instrument invented in Italy by
     Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700 (the exact year is uncertain), in
     which the strings are struck by wooden hammers that are coated with a softer
     material (modern hammers are covered with dense wool felt; some early pianos
     used leather). It is played using a keyboard, which is a row of keys (small levers)
     that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both
     hands to cause the hammers to strike the strings.</p>
